    <img src="poker_dogs.jpg" alt="4 dogs playing poker" div class="div1">
    <p>Anytime a family goes on vaction they always hope that everything is normal when they get home but are also prepared for an animal to have messed something up. So when the Johnsons had come home from their week in Branson and heard a noise coming from the attic, they had simply thought there waqs a racoon up there. Though when the father poked his head up to investigate with his flashlight what he saw stunned him. It was 4 dogs playing poker around his grandfathers old table!</p>

        <h2>Colleges now offering a free slice of bread to incentivize student attendance!</h2>
        <img src="bread.jpeg" alt="Slice of bread" width="300" height="400" div class="div2">
        <p>Colleges across the nation have noticed that students consistantly skip school atleast once a week for no reason even when the only go for 4 days so to conteract this they are starting a new policy. Every time a student goes every day in a week, they will be rewarded a free slice of bread. Test subjects have shown that this single slice would increase attendance by 1000%. This seems to be the most successful program to increase attendance in the history of colleges.</p>
